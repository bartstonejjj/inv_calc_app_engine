<h3 id="property">Renting vs buying your home</h3>
<p>In many developed countries and especially during boom periods, the ‘go to’ for investors has been property. “Buy a house, you can’t go wrong people say”, this may work out well, but it’s important to realise that the level of success you can achieve is dependent on many factors, e.g. mortgage size, property growth, rental growth, fees etc.</p>
<p>If you want to own your own home for lifestyle choices that’s also another consideration but the trade-off is lack of flexibility (you need to keep a job to pay the mortgage) and it’s a low-liquidity asset (it can take a while to sell if you need the cash). With a property you live in (as opposed to renting-out) this may reduce living costs, which ties back to the question "Should I rent or buy?".</p>
