<p>They come in many names and formats: actively managed (a.k.a mutual, 401k, superannuation), index (i.e. passively managed), and can be bought directly or through an ETF (Exchange Traded Fund), however at a high level they are all the same.</p>
<p>You give up capital to buy shares in a fund. The fund manager buys shares in various markets in hopes of having growth in share value and income from dividends (depending on the fund), which could be: US companies, large companies, small companies, real estate, international companies etc.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s a few variables to consider when finding out which fund is best for you, including what was the performance over the last 3, 5, 10, 20 years, and what are the fees, especially management fees. Even a difference of a fraction of a % in management fee can make a big difference to the overall returns to you, especially over the long term.</p>
