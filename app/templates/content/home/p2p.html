<h3 id="peer-to-peer-lending">Peer to peer</h3>
<p>Within a ‘lending market’, you offer to sell your capital to someone who wants to borrow it and repay you with interest over a certain number of years. This is effectively the same model as a home mortgage or car loan etc, except you are the lender.</p>
<p>Each month you receive a fixed amount returned to you by the borrower, which will include both principal and interest components. With these amounts you receive each month you can either: do nothing (not advised), re-invest into more P2P loans, re-invest into savings account, or invest elsewhere. There are trade-offs between each option which you won’t fully know until you run the calculations.</p>
