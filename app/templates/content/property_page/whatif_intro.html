<p>What would happen if any of your inputs above were different (since they're mainly estimates)? At what point would that change affect the results? Which inputs are more likely to change the results? The answers can be found in the graphs below.</p>
<p>Each graph corresponds to a different input (e.g. property growth). For each, start with the red dot (which indicates the current inputs/results), then follow the blue line to see how the 'Buy home' result changes with a change in this input. For example if property growth were higher, then so would the 'Buy home' result. In some cases, at some point this blue line may cross the dotted line, meaning the rent vs buy outcome has now changed!</p><p>When the blue line is higher, buying has better returns. Simarly for renting if dotted line is higher...</p>
