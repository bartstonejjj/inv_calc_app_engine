<p>This page compares owning your home to renting. For simplicity, we assume that the monthly cost of mortgage repayments is roughly the same as what you would pay if you had rented.</p>
<p><br />Enter your investments numbers below. Think about how much capital (cash) you would be willing to invest (as a deposit) to a home you buy and how long you would likely own it. Also try to estimate how much it might cost (in non financial charges) for: buying, selling and running this home. Many of these costs vary by region, so make sure you ask/google around to find out. Close estimates are okay as you will see below (in your graphs).</p>
