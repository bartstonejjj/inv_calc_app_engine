<p>What would happen if any of your inputs above were different (since some are estimates)? At what point would that change affect the results? Which inputs are more likely to change the results? The answers can be found in the graphs below.</p>
<p>Each graph corresponds to a different input (e.g. earnings). For each, start with the red dot (which indicates the current inputs/results), then follow the blue line to see how the 'Final investment value' result changes with a change in this input. For example if earnings were higher, then so would the 'Final investment value' result. </p>
